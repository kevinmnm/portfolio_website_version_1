<h1 id='welcome'>Hello, my name is Kevin Song!</h1>

<h2 id='welcome2'>I'm looking for my first job as a Junior Front-End Web Developer.</h2>

<p id='intro'>
    Welcome to my portfolio website! In this website, I want to introduce myself and how I stumbled into web development. I am currently looking for my first job as a junior front-end web developer. I am a newbie in the development industry. Since I started to learn HTML at the end of December of 2019, I fell deeply into web development and never stopped learning since then! My very first and second project was made for the company I work at, and it has help many employees like me to increase our productivity rate. You can find those projects in "Projects" tab above.
</p>
<p id='intro'>
    I wasn't hired as a web developer when I made those projects. I was just another regular agent doing the same work as other agents, until I became a team lead soon later - which still has nothing to do with coding. I always pondered how I could help my team to increase productivity rate, and how they can utilize better resources to understand things more easily.
